TuneMasher - Create mashup bangers, and share them with friends!

# User Stories and Task List

Stretch goals are |here|

## As a mashup maker, or listener, I want to be able to create an account, so that I can contribute to the website with a unique alias.

 - Create Login Authentication.

## As a mashup maker, I want to be able to pick two different tracks, either from a local machine or API, so I can create my banging tunes.

  - Create a form, with two file fields for the songs.


## As a mashup maker, I want the first song to play first, then the other song last, so that there's a logical order to the mashup.

## I want the songs selected to seek from start to end, on any part of the song I please, with a maximum of 30 seconds per clip.

## As a listener, I want to be able to rate mashup tracks on a scale of 1 - 5, |and add comments if I so desire|, to be able to share my voice on these mashups.

## As a mashup maker, I want to be able to delete my track, in case I make mistakes.

## |As a mashup maker, I want to be able to preview my track, before I upload it into the public. This is for privacy reasons.|

## Following CRUD principles, I want to create/read/delete songs. Disallow updating of songs.
 - Developers Note: The reason why updating the mashups is not allowed, is so that the comments and ratings are based on one version of the song. If someone were to update the song afterwards, the comments and ratings would be misleading.

## I want to be able to update the description of songs.
